# tuple is a data structure
# tuple can store any data type 
# most important -- tuples are immutable
                # -- once tuple is created you can't update

example=("one","two","three") 

# no append,no insert,no pop, no remove

# used where data can't be update
# example -- days=("monday","tuesday")

# tuples are faster than list

# methods used in tuple --
# count,index
# len function
# slicing
